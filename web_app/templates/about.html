    <p class="lead"><b>A Magic: The Gathering cube</b> is a custom set of Magic the Gathering cards that a player or group of players has put together for the purpose of drafting. These cubes often consist of a curated set of cards that allow for numerous draft possibilities. Cubes can vary widely in themes, sizes, and the power level of the cards included. They provide a reusable and personalized drafting experience without the need to purchase new packs.</p>

    <p class="lead"><b>P1P1</b> stands for "Pack 1, Pick 1." In the context of drafting a Magic: The Gathering cube (or any other draft format), it refers to the very first card a player chooses from the first pack that they open. This is often considered one of the most crucial choices in a draft, as it can set the direction for the player's strategy and card choices in subsequent rounds.</p>
